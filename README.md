# Datawarehousing

ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project focuses on the design of a Modern Data Warehouse using Medallion Architecture, consisting of three layers: Bronze, Silver, and Gold.


Bronze Layer: This layer stores raw, unprocessed data ingested from CSV files into Databricks.


Silver Layer: Data in this layer undergoes cleansing, standardization, and normalization to prepare it for analysis.


Gold Layer: The final layer consists of business-ready data, structured into fact and dimension tables, optimized for reporting and analytics using a star schema.


Project Details:
Data Architecture: Implemented a modern data warehouse design using Medallion Architecture (Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers) in Databricks.


ETL Pipelines: Developed pipelines for Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data from CSV files into the data warehouse.


Data Modeling: Created fact and dimension tables designed for efficient analytical querying and reporting.
Does this look good now?
